# Transparent Signature
Making a transparent signature from white paper 

Sometimes we need to sign a document digitally. I mean, open the document in a word processor and insert the signature and make a PDF to send. The usual way is singing on a white paper and take a photo from it and croping to a desire size. But the problem is that the background of the signature is white and maybe overlap the lines and texts on the document. By this script, it's possible to transform a white background of the signature to transparent. 

How to use:
Here, it's assumed that Python >3.6 and a new version of pip are installed on the system. In order to install the dependencies of the script in the terminal run the following command:
```bash
>>> pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
and then
```bash
>>> python signature.py
```bash
