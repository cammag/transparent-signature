# Transparent Signature
Making a transparent signature from white paper 

Sometimes we need to sign a document digitally. I mean, open the document in a word processor and insert the signature and make a PDF to send. The usual way is singing on a white paper and take a photo from it and croping to a desire size. But the problem is that the background of the signature is white and maybe overlap the lines and texts on the document. By this script, it's possible to transform a white background of the signature to transparent.
